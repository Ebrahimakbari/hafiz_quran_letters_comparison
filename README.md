# Quran/Hafiz Letter Frequency Analysis

This project calculates and visualizes the probability distribution, It allows users to compare letter frequencies across different fractions of the Quran, providing insights into letter distribution in various sections of the text.

## Features

- **Fraction-Based Analysis**: The user can specify a fraction of the text to analyze (e.g., 1.0 for the full text, 0.5 for the first half, 0.25 for the first quarter).
- **Probability Density Visualization**: Generates a line plot with a continuous representation of letter probabilities, allowing for comparison between fractions.
- **Comparison Plot**: Multiple fractions can be visualized on the same plot to observe how letter distributions vary.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `matplotlib`
- `collections`
- `re`

Install these dependencies with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
